This project was for CSE 482 Big Data Analysis. The goal of the project was to apply techniques we used in class to collect and visualize large amounts of data.  In this project, I collected around 15,878 wav sound recordings from 1209 unique users after preprocessesing the data. Then I applied machine learning techniques and sampling techniques to detect the gender, age, and dialect of the sound recording.
